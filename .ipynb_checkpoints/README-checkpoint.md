# Housing Market Predictive Model
This is a personal project. The goal is to build a regression model for predicting housing prices in VA. For my personal usage, I will be focusing on the Alexandria, VA area, however, the intention is to create a model that can predict a house's selling price based on city, square-fottage, and other given features.

## The Data
The data is provided by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/en.html) from the [Manufactured Housing Survey (Public Use Files)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2021/econ/MHS/puf.html). The current data available is from the years 2014-2023, all of which will be used to build and test the predictive model. 
> N.B. unfortuately, while the U.S. Census Bureau is currently working on developing their APIs for data access, the MHS data is currently not available through API.
